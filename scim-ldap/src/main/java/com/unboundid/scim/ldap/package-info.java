/**
 * This package contains classes that map SCIM resources to LDAP entries and
 * vice versa. It also contains several APIs that may be used to implement
 * custom behaviours for the mapping configuration file to extend its
 * capabilities above and beyond those provided out of the box. Each extension
 * type varies in the amount of control the implementation have over the mapping
 * process and  the amount of effort required for implementation. The extension
 * types include:
 * <BR><BR>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.unboundid.scim.ldap.Transformation} - For altering the
 *   values of mapped attribute</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.unboundid.scim.ldap.DerivedAttribute} - For generating the
 *   value of a read-only SCIM attribute</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.unboundid.scim.ldap.ResourceMapper} - For overriding the
 *   behaviour of any part of the mapping process</li>
 * </ul>
