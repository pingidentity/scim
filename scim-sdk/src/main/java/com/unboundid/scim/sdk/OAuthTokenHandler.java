/**
 * This class defines an API that must be implemented by extensions which will
 * handle incoming SCIM requests with OAuth 2.0 bearer token authentication.
 * The OAuthTokenHandler is responsible for decoding the bearer token and
 * checking it for authenticity and validity.
 * <BR><BR>
 * OAuth provides a method for clients to access a protected resource on
 * behalf of a resource owner. In the general case, before a client can
 * access a protected resource, it must first obtain an authorization
 * grant from the resource owner and then exchange the authorization
 * grant for an access token. The access token represents the grant's
 * scope, duration, and other attributes specified by the authorization
 * grant. The client accesses the protected resource by presenting the
 * access token to the resource server (i.e. the Identity Data Store or Identity
 * Proxy with the SCIM HTTP Servlet enabled).
 * <BR><BR>
 * The access token provides an abstraction, replacing different
 * authorization constructs (e.g., username and password, assertion) for
 * a single token understood by the resource server. This abstraction
 * enables issuing access tokens valid for a short time period, as well
 * as removing the resource server's need to understand a wide range of
 * authentication schemes. See "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer
 * Token Usage" (<i>RFC 6750</i>) for the full
 * specification and details.
 * <BR><BR>
 * TLS security is required to use OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, as specified in
 * <i>RFC 6750</i>. A bearer token may be used by any party
 * in possession of that token (the "bearer"), and thus needs to be protected
 * when transmitted across the network. Implementations of this API should take
 * special care to verify that the token came from a trusted source (using a
 * secret key or some other signing mechanism to prove that the token is
 * authentic). Please read "OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations"
 * (<i>RFC 6819</i>) for a comprehensive list of
 * security threats to consider when working with OAuth bearer tokens.
 * <BR><BR>
 * The OAuthTokenHandler is also responsible for extracting an authorization DN
 * from the bearer token (or otherwise providing one), which will be used to
 * apply access controls before returning the protected resource. There are also
 * methods to extract the expiration date of the token as well as verify that
 * the intended audience is this server (to deal with token redirect).
 * <BR><BR>
 * The order these methods are called by the SCIM HTTP Servlet Extension is as
 * follows:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><i>decodeOAuthToken()</i></li>
 *   <li><i>isTokenAuthentic()</i></li>
 *   <li><i>isTokenForThisServer()</i></li>
 *   <li><i>isTokenExpired()</i></li>
 *   <li><i>validateToken()</i></li>
 *   <li><i>getAuthzDN()</i></li>
 * </ol>
 * If any of the methods fail or return an error result, the server will return
 * an appropriate "unauthorized" response to the client.
