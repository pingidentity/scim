/**
 * This class represents an individual operation within a bulk operation
 * request or response. The fields are defined as follows, in the order that
 * they must be encoded when XML is the content type:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Each operation corresponds to a single HTTP request against a Resource
 * endpoint. REQUIRED.
 *
 *    method
 *        The HTTP method of the current operation. Possible values are POST,
 *        PUT, PATCH or DELETE. REQUIRED.
 *    bulkId
 *        The transient identifier of a newly created Resource, unique within
 *        a bulk request and created by the Consumer. The bulkId serves as a
 *        surrogate Resource id enabling Consumers to uniquely identify newly
 *        created Resources in the Response and cross reference new Resources
 *        in and across operations within a bulk request. REQUIRED when method
 *        is POST.
 *    version
 *        The current Resource version. Version is REQUIRED if the Service
 *        Provider supports ETags and the method is PUT, DELETE, or PATCH.
 *    path
 *        The Resource's relative path. If the method is POST the value must
 *        specify a Resource type endpoint; e.g., /Users or /Groups whereas
 *        all other method values must specify the path to a specific Resource;
 *        e.g., /Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646.
 *        REQUIRED in a request.
 *    location
 *        The Resource endpoint URL. REQUIRED in a response, except in the
 *        event of a POST failure.
 *    data
 *        The Resource data as it would appear for a single POST, PUT or PATCH
 *        Resource operation. REQUIRED in a request when method is POST, PUT
 *        and PATCH.
 *    status
 *        A complex type that contains information about the success or failure
 *        of one operation within the bulk job. REQUIRED in a response.
 *
 *        code
 *            The HTTP response code that would have been returned if a single
 *            HTTP request would have been used. REQUIRED.
 *        description
 *            A human readable error message. REQUIRED when an error occurred.
 *
 * </pre>
